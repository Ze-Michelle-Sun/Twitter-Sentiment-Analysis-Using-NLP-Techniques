# Sentiment-Analysis-tweets

In this noteboook,we have used two of the most popular libraries for sentiment analysis on text data i.e TextBlob and Vader

Over here, we fetched tweets of Bill Gates and Elon Musk

We Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data to answer questions like how many tweets we have or any values are missing or not

Then, we did some text pre-processing on text data to remove extra material like stop words, converting plural to singular, etc

Finally, performed sentimental analysis using both NLP techniques and compared their result and state our observation
