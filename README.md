# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using NLP Techniques - TextBlob And Vader

In this noteboook,I have used two of the most popular libraries for sentiment analysis on text data i.e TextBlob and Vader.

Over here, I fetched tweets of Bill Gates and Elon Musk.

I Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data to answer questions like how many tweets I have or any values are missing or not.

Then, I did some text pre-processing on text data to remove extra material like stop words, converting plural to singular, etc.

Finally, performed sentimental analysis using both NLP techniques and compared their result and state my observation.
