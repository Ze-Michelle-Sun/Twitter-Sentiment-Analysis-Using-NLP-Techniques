# Twitter Sentiment Analysis Using NLP Techniques - TextBlob And Vader

In this project, used two of the most popular libraries for sentiment analysis on text data i.e **TextBlob** and **Vader**.

- Fetched tweets of **Bill Gates** and **Elon Musk**.

- Performed Exploratory Data Analysis on the data to answer questions like how many tweets I have or any values are missing or not.

- Conducted some text pre-processing on text data to remove extra material like stop words, converting plural to singular, etc.

- Performed sentimental analysis using both NLP techniques and compared their result and state of observation.
